# Changelog

### 1.0.0
- Initial release
- Make toolbar button icons for JavaScript and images more distinguishable (as reported from a review)
- Remove tab bar option since this is already in Pale Moon by default
- Remove show images checkbox since Pale Moon already has a 3-state menu list
- Remove tabs on top checkbox since it feels redundant already (if you want this to be restored, feel free to do so in the issue tracker)
