# SettingInsanity
SettingInsanity is a fork of the [SettingSanity](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/settingsanity/) add-on for Firefox by RealityRipple.
It is an add-on that restores a few settings that were removed from the Options window. It also adds the option of toolbar buttons for toggling Images and JavaScript without opening your preferences.

Share and Enjoy, Share and Enjoy,
Journey through life with a plastic boy
Or girl by your side, let your pal be your guide,
And when it breaks down or starts to annoy,
Or grinds when it moves and gives you no joy
Cos it's eaten your hat or had sex with your cat,
Bled oil on your floor or ripped off your door,
And you get to the point you can't stand any more,
Bring it to us, we won't give a fig.
We'll tell you 'Go stick your head in a Pig'
